# Midterm Project

## Project Goals
Build a model to predict who would most likely survive the Titanic

## Process
1. Download data from Kaggle
2. Clean and Review data
3. Create EDAs and Models
4. Compare and evaluate results
5. Create Visualizations
6. Present findings

## Results

For this dataset, I tried to use a Linear Model, however, the outputs were skewed. I realized classification models would work better for this dataset. 

I also used a Logistical Regression Model to confirm accuracy. I used Survived as my dependent variable and Ticket class, Sex, Age, Relatives, and Embarked as my independent variables. Based on the data, this model provided a 79% accuracy score, which is good, however, does leave room for improvement.

However, I also used the Random Forest model on the Titanic dataset to predict survival based on three key factors: ticket class, sex, and number of relatives. First-class passengers are more likely to survive due to their wealth and access to lifeboats. Female passengers are more likely to survive due to the priority given to women and children. Passengers with fewer relatives are more likely to survive due to their care from other passengers. Age and embarked are also correlated with survival, but to a lesser extent.

## Challenges

My biggest challenge was agreeing on a dataset. 

## Future Goals

Just move forward and complete the project.
